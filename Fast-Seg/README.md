# Incognito: Real time background segmentation for video-conferencing
Package for live background segmentation for CPU based video-conferencing.

## Repo Structure
**data** : Contains dataset handler, sample data, final compressed models and results

**experiments** : Base model and Efficient model training experiments

**model** : Model architecture definition

**optimization** : Quantization and Pruning optimization techniques

**utils** : Helper utilities

**evaluate.py** : Model evaluation script

**live_webcam.py** : Demonstrates live webcam segmentation using final trained model

**train.py** : Base trainer



## Setup
Clone repository
Docker container - (WIP)
```
WIP
```


## Run Inference

```
python live_webcam.py
```

## Build Model
- Include instructions of how to build the model
- This can be done either locally or on the cloud
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Serve Model
- Include instructions of how to set up a REST or RPC endpoint
- This is for running remote inference via a custom model
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Analysis
- Include some form of EDA (exploratory data analysis)
- And/or include benchmarking of the model and results
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```
